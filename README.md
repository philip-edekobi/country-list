# Country List

Country list is a small project I made out of frustration.

### Backstory

I needed a list of countries and their flags for a small project of mine but strangely, I couldn't find any. I either saw the flags alone or the countries alone.

I dug for a while and then stumbled on an api, [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/), which contains all the countries in the world along with an extreme amount of details concerning each country.

Now, I only needed the names and flags so I couldn't use the entire API. Therefore, I decided to scrape it and leave the code out there for anyone who might find themselves in a similar situation in future.
